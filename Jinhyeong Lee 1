\maketitle
\begin{defn} $K$ be any field, and $f(x) \in K[x]$ be a cubic polynomial with coefficients in $K$ which has distinct roots in $K$ or extension of $K$. We assume $K$ does not have characteristic 2. The solutions of the equation
\[y^2 = f(x)\]
are called $K'$-points of the elliptic curve and the equation is called elliptic curve.
\end{defn}

Let $F(x,y)=y^2 -f(x)$. For example $F(x,y)=y^2 -(x^3 -n^2 x)$. To make this equation dimensional homogeneous, we take the total dimension $k$ of $F(x,y)$ and let $\tilde{F}(x,y,z)=z^nF( \displaystyle\frac{x}{z},\displaystyle\frac{y}{z})$. For example $\tilde{F}(x,y,z)=y^2z-(x^3 -n^2xz^2)$ in our example. Then we can easily check the fact that
\[\tilde{F}(x,y,z)=0 \Leftrightarrow F(\displaystyle\frac{x}{z},\displaystyle\frac{y}{z})=0 (z \neq0)\]

Next we will define the fundamental parallelogram for $\omega_1,\omega_2$.

\begin{defn} $\Pi=\{a\omega_1 +b\omega_2 | 0\leq a\leq 1,0\leq b \leq 1\}$. For $ \displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} \notin \mathbb{R}$

And the lattice $L=\{m\omega_1 +n\omega_2 |m,n\in \mathbb{Z}\} $
\end{defn}

And we may assume the imaginary part of $ \displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}$ is positive.

\begin{defn}
A lattice $L$ is given, $f$ is called elliptic function relative to $L$ if it is meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ and $f(z+l)=f(z)$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C} ,l \in L$.
\end{defn}

We will denote the set of elliptic functions relative to $L$ by $\mathcal{E}_L$. Then $\mathcal{E}_L$ is a subfield of the all meromorphic functions and closed by sum, difference, product, quotient, and differentiation.

\begin{prop}
A function $f(z) \in \mathcal{E}_L$ has no pole in the fundamental parallelogram $\Pi$ must be a constant.
\end{prop}

This is immediate result from Liouville's theorem.

\begin{prop}
$\alpha+\Pi =\{\alpha+z|z\in\Pi\}$. Suppose $f(z) \in \mathcal{E}_L$ has no poles on the boundary $C$ of $\alpha+\Pi$. Then the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ in $\alpha+\Pi$ is zero.
\end{prop}

By residue theorem, the sum of the residues can be expressed as

\[ \displaystyle\frac{1}{2\pi i} \displaystyle\int_C f(z)dz\]

and since $f(z)$ has the same value on the parallel sides with opposite orientation, the integral value is exactly zero. Also by this proposition, we can check that non constant $f(z) \in \mathcal{E}_L $ has at least two poles or has a multiple pole, since if it has only one simple pole, then the residue cannot be zero.

\begin{prop}
Suppose $f(z)$ has no zeros on the boundary of $\alpha +\Pi$. Then the sum of orders of zeros of $f(z)$ is equal to the sum of orders of poles of $f(z)$.
\end{prop}

Since $\mathcal{E}_L$ is closed under differentiation and quotients, and $f(z)$ has no zeros on the boundary of $\alpha +\Pi$, $\displaystyle\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$ is also an elliptic function and by proposition 2 and the fact that the sum of the residues of $\displaystyle\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$ is the difference between the sum of orders of zeros of $f(z)$ and the sum of orders of poles of $f(z)$.

\begin{defn}
The Weierstrass $\mathfrak{P}$-function 
\[\mathfrak{P}(z)=\mathfrak{P}(z;L)= \displaystyle\frac{1}{z^2} +\sum_{0\neq l\in L}{ \left( \displaystyle\frac{1}{(z-l)^2}-\displaystyle\frac{1}{l^2 }\right) }\]

\end{defn}
It is introduced as the key example of an elliptic function.

\begin{prop}
The Weierstrass $\mathfrak{P}$-function converges absolutely and uniformly on any compact set in $\mathbb{C}\setminus L$

\end{prop}

For a compact set in $\mathbb{C}\setminus L$, 
\[\sum_{0\neq l\in L}{  \displaystyle\frac{1}{(z-l)^2}}, \sum_{0\neq l\in L}\displaystyle\frac{1}{l^2 } \] both converges absolutely and uniformly since $L$ is a lattice.

Also the differentiation of the Weierstrass $\mathfrak{P}$-function is
\[\mathfrak{P}'(z)=-2\displaystyle\sum_{l\in L} \displaystyle\frac{1}{(z-l)^3 }\]

Next theorem is the main result in this report. An arbitrary elliptic function can be rationally expressed in $\mathfrak{P}(z)$, $\mathfrak{P}'(z)$. It is why the Weierstrass $\mathfrak{P}$ function was introduced as the key example of the elliptic functions.

\begin{thm}
Any elliptic function for L is a rational expression in $\mathfrak{P}(z)$, $\mathfrak{P}'(z)$. $\forall f(z) \in \mathcal{E}_L$, there exist two rational functions $g(X)$, $h(X)$ such that \[f(z)=g(\mathfrak{P}(z))+\mathfrak{P}'(z)h(\mathfrak{P}(z))\]


\end{thm}
For the proof, we will use a lemma.
\begin{lem}
The subfield $\mathcal{E}_L^+ \subset \mathcal{E}_L$ of even elliptic functions for $L$ is generated by $\mathfrak{P}(z)$, i.e., $\mathcal{E}_L^+ =\mathbb{C}(\mathfrak{P})$

\end{lem}

(pf) We will construct a function which has the same poles and zeros as $f(z)$ using $\mathfrak{P}(z)$. 

First let $\Pi '=\{a\omega_1+b\omega_2\}$ and for $a \in \Pi'$($a\neq 0,\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{2},\displaystyle\frac{\omega_2}{2},\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}$), let
\[
a^* =     \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}
         \omega_1 +\omega_2 -a & \mbox{for} & a\in \dot{\Pi'} \\
         \omega_1 -a  & \mbox{for} & a=k\omega_1 \\
         \omega_2 -a  & \mbox{for} & a=k\omega_2
                \end{array}\right.
\]
then $a\neq a^*$ and the multiplicity of $a$ is equal to the multiplicity of $a^*$. This is because the double periodicity, we have $f(a^* -z)=f(-a-z)=f(a+z)$ since $f$ is even. Thus, $f(a+z)$ and $f(a^* +z)$ have the same degree of Laurent series.

Also in the case of $a= \displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{2},\displaystyle\frac{\omega_2}{2},\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}$, we can check that $a$ has the even multiplicity of zero or pole since $f(\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{2}+z)=f(-\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{2}+z)=f(\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{2}-z)$ and this implies that the highest degree $m$ must be even so that $a_mz^m=a_m(-z)^m$.

By this fact we can list zeros and poles as multi set $\{a_i\}$,$\{b_i\}$ respectively. We only list one of $a, a^*$ for the multi set and we list them by their multiplicity. In the case of $a= \displaystyle\frac{\omega_1}{2},\displaystyle\frac{\omega_2}{2},\displaystyle\frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}$, we list them half of the multiplicity times. Thus the cardinality of the multi set is half of the cardinality of zeros of $f(z)$.

Since $a_i$'s and $b_i$'s are nonzero, the elliptic function
\[g(z)= \displaystyle\frac{\prod(\mathfrak{P}(z)-\mathfrak{P}(a_i))}{\prod(\mathfrak{P}(z)-\mathfrak{P}(b_i))}\]
is well defined. Our claim is that $g(z)$ has the exactly same zeros and poles as $f(z)$.

Since $\mathfrak{P}(z)-\mathfrak{P}(a_i)$ has a double zero if $a_i$ is half lattice point and $\mathfrak{P}(z)-\mathfrak{P}(a_i)$ has a pair of zero at $a_i$ and $a_i^*$ otherwise, we can check that $g,f$ has the same poles and zeros except at $z=0$. In addition by Proposition 3 above, they also has the same multiplicity at $z=0$ and by Proposition 1, we can have $f(z)=cg(z)$.

For the proof of the theorem, since \[f(z)=\left( \displaystyle\frac{f(z)+f(-z)}{2} \right)+ \mathfrak{P}'(z)\left(\displaystyle\frac{f(z)-f(-z)}{2\mathfrak{P}'(z)}\right)\]
and both of them are even elliptic functions, by Lemma, we have $f(z)=g(\mathfrak{P}(z))+\mathfrak{P}'(z)h(\mathfrak{P}(z))$.
